# Energy-Consumption-Analysis

Technologies: 
Data Cleansing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Visualization (Power BI)

Problem Statement:
This project focuses on analyzing energy usage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within Ontario's Broader Public Sector (BPS) organizations. Leveraging a comprehensive database spanning from 2012 to 2021, the objective is to identify trends, assess conservation effectiveness, and pinpoint areas for improvement. The insights derived will inform data-driven strategies to achieve climate change mitigation goals within the BPS.

Data Understanding:
The dataset encompasses information about BPS organizations, including public hospitals and school boards. Key attributes cover organization details, operational information, energy consumption data, and GHG emissions.

Key Features:

Sector: Represents the sector of the organization (e.g., Public Hospital, School Board).
SubSector: Provides further classification within the sector.
Organization: Name of the BPS organization.
Operation: Specific operation or facility within the organization.
Address, City, Postal Code: Location details of the organization.
Energy Usage: Information about electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, propane, coal, wood, district heating, and district cooling consumption.
GHG Emissions: Greenhouse gas emissions in kilograms.
Data Preparation and Cleansing:
Clean and transform the data into a format suitable for analysis by handling missing values, standardizing units, and deriving relevant features. Segment the data by factors like sector, organization type, and facility size.

Exploratory Data Analysis - PowerBI:
Employ statistical analysis and visualization techniques to uncover key trends, patterns, and relationships within the data. Investigate correlations between energy consumption, GHG emissions, and features like building size, operational hours, and weather data. Identify outliers and potential areas for further investigation.

Develop compelling and interactive visualizations using Tableau or Power BI to effectively communicate key insights from the EDA. Create dashboards showcasing energy consumption and GHG emissions by sector, organization, and facility type. Design comparative visualizations to analyze performance trends and benchmark organizations against established metrics.
